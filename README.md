- `defi_skeptic.json`
- `crypto_researcher.json`

Each personality file contains:
- Detailed bio and background
- Knowledge areas and expertise
- Communication style preferences
- Example messages and posts
- Characteristic adjectives

### Central Configuration
`config.json` manages:
- Target subreddits
- Rate limits
- Interaction settings
- Conversation depth
- Post frequency

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Reddit account with API access
- OpenAI API key (GPT-4 access)
- SQLite (included with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/redharmony.git
cd redharmony
```

2. Create and activate Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure your `.env` file with API credentials:
```env
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"

# Reddit Configuration
REDDIT_USERNAME="your_username"
REDDIT_PASSWORD="your_password"
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
REDDIT_USER_AGENT="script:redharmony:v1.0 (by u/your_username)"
```

   - Random KOL selection
   - Natural title generation
   - Content creation with personality signature
   - Automatic flair selection

2. **Comment Generation**:
   - Contextual response generation
   - Personality-appropriate insights
   - Natural conversation flow
   - Clear KOL attribution

3. **Discussion Dynamics**:
   - Technical discussions between system experts
   - Market analysis debates
   - Critical perspective integration
   - Academic insights and research views

## Best Practices

1. Monitor interactions for quality and authenticity
2. Regularly review personality configurations
3. Adjust rate limits based on community response
4. Keep conversation flows natural and engaging
5. Respect subreddit-specific guidelines

## Development Status

Current focus areas:
- [x] Multi-KOL system implementation
- [x] Natural conversation flow
- [x] Personality-specific content generation
- [x] Dynamic flair management
- [x] Rate limiting and timing controls
- [x] Clear personality attribution
- [ ] Advanced conversation branching
- [ ] Personality memory system
- [ ] Analytics dashboard

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. Rate limit errors: Check `config.json` timing settings
2. Authentication failures: Verify Reddit API credentials
3. Database errors: Ensure proper SQLite setup
4. Content generation issues: Check OpenAI API key and quota

## Security Note

Never commit sensitive credentials to the repository. Always use environment variables for API keys and authentication details. The `.env` file is automatically ignored by git to prevent accidental exposure of credentials.

## Deployment

### Local Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the service
docker-compose down
```

### Digital Ocean Deployment

1. Create a Digital Ocean account and generate an access token

2. Set up GitHub Secrets:
   - `DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your DO access token
   - `DIGITALOCEAN_REGISTRY`: Your DO registry name
   - `DROPLET_HOST`: Your droplet's IP address
   - `DROPLET_USERNAME`: Your droplet's SSH username
   - `DROPLET_SSH_KEY`: Your SSH private key for the droplet

3. Create a Digital Ocean droplet:
   ```bash
   # Create a new droplet with Docker pre-installed
   doctl compute droplet create redharmony \
     --image docker-20-04 \
     --size s-1vcpu-1gb \
     --region nyc1 \
     --ssh-keys your-ssh-key-id
   ```

4. Initial server setup:
   ```bash
   # SSH into your droplet
   ssh root@your-droplet-ip

   # Create application directory
   mkdir -p /opt/redharmony
   cd /opt/redharmony

   # Copy your .env file
   nano .env  # Paste your environment variables
   ```

5. Push to GitHub:
   - The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
     - Build the Docker image
     - Push to Digital Ocean Container Registry
     - Deploy to your droplet
     - Restart the service

### Continuous Deployment

The system is configured for continuous deployment:
1. Push changes to main/master branch
2. GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys
3. New version runs on Digital Ocean
4. Database persists between deployments

### Monitoring

1. View logs:
   ```bash
   # SSH into droplet
   ssh root@your-droplet-ip
   
   # View logs
   cd /opt/redharmony
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

2. Check status:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```
